# Baldi's Seeds Extension
This mod makes BB+ able to expand its int-32 bits limit into a real int64 limit, you can now input numbers with an unexplainable length!
Quick note: this might make the generation slower on the beginning due to how it is implemented, but you'll still receive the expected result
